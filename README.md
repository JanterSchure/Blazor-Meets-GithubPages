# Blazor-Meets-GithubPages

This repo is setup for a demo and showcase for a talk I am preparing. 

Big shout-out to https://swimburger.net/blog/dotnet/how-to-deploy-aspnet-blazor-webassembly-to-github-pages for the guide on how to make this work. 

My intention for my presentation is to spread knowledge on how Github pages work and how to make Blazor work on Github pages.   

Idea for the presentation is:
- Routing fixes for pages. 
- How to add a custom domain for your pages

First repo I used this for myself: https://github.com/JanterSchure/CircleOfInfluenceTool?tab=readme-ov-file
